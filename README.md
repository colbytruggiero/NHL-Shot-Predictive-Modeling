# NHL-Shot-Predictive-Modeling

Being universally recognized as the premier professional hockey organization in the world, the National Hockey League (NHL) is home to players who consistently perform at an elite level. These athletes earn various rewards for their exceptional performances, whether monetary or through accolades, which amateur hockey players worldwide can simply only dream of. NHL players are able to skate faster, shoot harder, and make significantly better decisions under pressure compared to amateur players; moreover, these professional athletes are able to perform at this high level against the toughest competition in the world on a consistent basis.

The evolution of the game of hockey is also quite the marvel. From the old days of the face-hugging goalie mask and only six teams within the league to the advanced stick technology and ever-expanding thirty-two team league of todayâ€™s age, the NHL is consistently growing as a result of societal innovation and improvements. One of these key developments within the NHL has been the rapid rise of advanced analytics used within the professional game as a way to gain particular insights into player/team performance.

From a fan engagement standpoint, many hockey broadcasts utilize these advanced statistics in order to provide analysis during games in real time. The use of providing these metrics is to help viewers understand the flow of the game, the quality of chances being scoring chances that are generated, and much more. These statistics include the likes of skater speed during the game, which can be seen below in **Figure 1.1**.

Besides watching broadcasts, the everyday NHL fan can also gain particular insights into their favorite players or teams through various databases containing hockey statistics throughout the season. One example of this is *NHL Edge* (seen in **Figure 1.2**), a database that was developed in 2023 by the NHL themselves to promote "Puck and Player Tracking Statistics" and make them readily available to the public.

Of all of these statistics, by far the most important, as well as most interesting to the general public, is goal-scoring. Whether or not a player is able to score in a game or throughout the season can make-or-break their chances for individual rewards or their team's chances at sustained success. For this model project, we will be utilizing play-by-play data from the 2023-2024 season in order to create an algorithm that predict whether or not a shot-on-goal did in fact result in a goal.

Because shooting opportunities can be very skewed within the game of hockey, we will be looking into two different shot scenarios, and thus creating two separate models. The first model will be so-called **Normal Shots**, meaning that these shows are those that occur in regulation time or overtime (periods 1-4). The second model will be the shots that occur without any defenders, the **1v0 Shots**. These shots occur either during a penalty shot or during a shootout. The reasoning behind splitting these scoring opportunities is that shots that penalty shots/shootout attempts occur with zero defenders in player except for the goalie, so the percent chance that a goal occurs during these plays is much higher.
